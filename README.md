This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## AI Verification & Proofing
The platform now includes an automated verification flow for bets:
1.  **AI Analysis**: The creator can ask the AI to determine the result of a bet based on its internal knowledge.
2.  **Admin/Creator Approval**: The creator reviews the suggestion and approves it.
3.  **Proofing Period**: A 24-hour dispute window (Proofing) starts.
4.  **Final Resolution**: Once the proofing period ends, the result is confirmed and points are distributed.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
